# Helmet Detection using Image Classification

This project implements an **image classification pipeline for helmet detection** using deep learning.
The goal is to classify images into **Helmet** and **No Helmet** categories for road safety and surveillance use cases.

The implementation is provided as a Jupyter Notebook for clarity and reproducibility.
